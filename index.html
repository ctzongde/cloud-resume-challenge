            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My journey into cloud engineering started when my team needed to deploy an AI application fast, but without spending on physical servers. That's when I discovered how cloud computing could tackle both challenges at once, and I was hooked. I went beyond my role and built a data pipeline connecting Amazon Aurora to an EC2-hosted web application, letting researchers add data in real time. Seeing how the right infrastructure helps teams move faster really clicked for me. I love that the cloud lets you build, test, and improve quickly. I think the best solutions come from trying things out and learning as you go, not getting everything perfect on the first try. Now I'm working toward becoming a cloud engineer who creates infrastructure that actually helps businesses get things done.</p>
